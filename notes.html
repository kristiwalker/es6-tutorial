# variables
    - const
    - var
    - let
    - es6 trick to swap values of variables
      [first, second] = [second, first];

# arrow functions
    - `this` scopes to the parent function with arrow functions, meaning you don't need to do var self = this, usually.
    - explicit and implicit returns
    - can't name arrow functions, but can put them in a variable
    - can define default arguments

# template strings
    - can make dictionaries (arry/object of props/values) to loop
    - can use tagged templates to loop through dictionary and customize in certain spots according to a certain function
    - es6 rest operator (...values) takes the rest of the values that are passed in an argument and puts them in an array
    - templating similar to handlebars
    - can use with ternary operator to say "if this, then that, otherwise nothing"

# string Methods (simple queries)
    - .startsWith()
    - .endsWith()
    - .includes()
    - .repeat()

# Destructuring
    - can pass objects to functions ({tip: 100, total: 200})
    - can provide a property for values in an array to reference them rather than saying array[0], array[3] to retrieve them
    - const { first, last, twitter } = person;
        says: give me a var called first, a var called last, and one called twitter, and take them from person

# iteratbles & Looping
    - can abort and skip things
    - less confusing syntax
    - using [i, cut] allows us to destructure the data
    - `for in` is probably best for looping objects since for of needs an Object.keys

# array improvements
    - Array.from = lets you take things like arguments and nodeLists and make their contents into arrays
    - Array.of = makes an array out of arguments in one simple line
    - .find = loops through array and returns item that matches implicit conditional
    - .filter = loos through array and returns items that match implicit conditional
    - .findIndex = loops through array and returns idex of item that matches implicit conditional
